#       U.S. Energy Production and Consumption (1973-2024) Power BI Dashboard

# Overview

This Power BI dashboard visualizes energy production, consumption, and trade data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), spanning from January 1973 to September 2024. The goal of this project is to analyze the trends and patterns in energy usage, comparing fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy sources, and assessing the U.S.â€™s energy import-export balance.

# Key Questions Answered
            
            How has the overall energy production in the U.S. evolved from 1973 to 2024, and what are the key trends across fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy?

            Answer: The data reveals that total energy production has generally increased over time, with notable growth in renewable energy production starting in the mid-2000s. Fossil fuels remain the largest contributor to energy production, though their growth has plateaued in recent years. Nuclear energy production has remained relatively stable throughout the period.
            What is the relationship between U.S. energy consumption and production, and during what periods has the U.S. been energy self-sufficient or reliant on imports?

            Answer: There is a strong correlation between energy consumption and production, with the U.S. experiencing periods of energy reliance up until the 2000s. Afterward, thanks to increased production, particularly from renewables, the U.S. has moved towards energy self-sufficiency, especially in the 2010s and 2020s.
            How has the share of renewable energy in total primary energy production changed over time, and when did significant growth in renewable energy begin?

            Answer: Renewable energy's share of total production has steadily increased, especially after 2005. This growth corresponds with technological advancements and policy changes promoting wind, solar, and biomass energy. By 2020, renewables had a notable impact on reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
            How have U.S. energy imports and exports shifted over time, and what has been the trend in net energy imports?

            Answer: Energy imports peaked in the 1990s and early 2000s, while exports have consistently risen, particularly since 2010. As a result, net energy imports have decreased significantly, with the U.S. becoming a net energy exporter in recent years, marking a major shift in energy trade.
            What impact has the development of renewable energy had on fossil fuel consumption, and how has the consumption of nuclear energy changed in the same period?

            Answer: The increase in renewable energy has led to a modest decline in fossil fuel consumption, particularly coal. However, fossil fuels remain dominant. Nuclear energy consumption has remained relatively constant, contributing consistently to the overall energy mix.
            Are there any noticeable seasonal patterns in energy production and consumption, and do these patterns differ across fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy?

            Answer: Seasonal patterns are evident, particularly in fossil fuel consumption, which tends to rise in the winter months due to heating demands. Renewable energy production, such as solar, peaks during the summer months, while nuclear energy remains more constant throughout the year.
            How do changes in energy stock levels reflect fluctuations in energy supply and demand, and what are the key periods of stockpiling or depletion?

            Answer: Changes in energy stock levels often correspond to external events, such as economic recessions or policy shifts. Stockpiling is more common in periods of energy surplus, while depletion tends to happen during times of increased consumption or reduced production, particularly during cold winters or geopolitical events impacting energy imports.
